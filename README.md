# A constructive Characterisation of Interval Graphs

This repository contains Python modules accompanying a forthcoming paper titled _"A constructive characterisation of interval graphs"_.

In that work, we propose an iterative procedure for constructing interval graphs. As a byproduct, we derived various results. The purpose of this repository is to provide computational implementations for testing and illustrating those results. 

Each module in this repository corresponds to a specific a definition or result:
1.  proposition1.py
2.  proposition3.py
3.  definition7 proposition4.py
4.  proposition7.py
5.  table2.py
