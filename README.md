# A constructive Characterisation of Interval Graphs

This repository stores the Python modules accompanying a forthcoming paper titled *"A constructive characterisation of interval graphs"*.

In that work, we propose an iterative procedure for constructing interval graphs. As a byproduct, we derived various results. The purpose of this repository is to provide computational implementations for testing and illustrating those results. 

Each module in [main/src](https://github.com/n-chikh/A-constructive-characterisation-of-interval-graphs/tree/main/src) corresponds to a specific a definition or result in the paper:
1.  proposition1.py
2.  proposition3.py
3.  definition7_proposition4.py
4.  proposition5.py
5.  corollary1_corollary2.py
6.  proposition7.py
7.  table2.py

| Module      | Definition/result |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| proposition1.py      | Proposition 1       |
| proposition3.py   | Proposition 3       |
| definition7_proposition4.py   | Definition 7, Proposition 4       |
| proposition5.py   | Proposition 5       |
| corollary1_corollary2.py   | Corallary 1, Corollary 2       |
| proposition7.py   | Proposition 7       |
| table2.py   | Table 2      |
