# A constructive Characterisation of Interval Graphs

This repository containq Python modules accompanying a forthcoming paper titled _"A constructive characterisation of interval graphs"_.

In that work, we propose an iterative procedure for constructing interval graphs. As a byproduct, we derived various results. The purpose of this repository is to provide computational implementations for testing and illustrating those results. 

Each module in this repository corresponds to a specific definition, property or algorithm. The list below outlines this correspondence:
